## Inspiration

The inspiration behind Formify is to simplify and humanise the tedious task of human entry. In various industries and everyday life, we spend a significant amount of time manually entering information that can sometimes be repetitive. Through voice-to-text automation, we can reduce the time doing these repetitive tasks, freeing professionals to focus on the tasks that truly matter, like taking care of patients, strategically planning a client's financials, personalising teaching, and having a human conversation. 

Simply create your form, have a conversation, and watch your form fill up in **real time!**

We made this with people in mind - to make interactions more human and life a little easier.

## What it does

The website allows you to create personalised forms, record yourself having a conversation, and as you are talking it fills out the form for you in real time!

Create forms using **drag-and-drop blocks** that already have the common fields you might need. This way, you can spend less time preparing and more time actually getting things done. View the forms you created and start recording! It's as easy as that!

## How we built it

The core motivation was simple: eliminate the boredom and inefficiency of filling out forms by making the process as natural as having a conversation. Hence, Formify encapsulates our goal of personalizing the form-filling experience and seamlessly placing control into the user's hands (or rather, their voice!).

Inspired by everyday conversations, Formify leverages cutting-edge voice technology powered by **OpenAI Whisper** to translate speech into precise data entries in real time. No more tedious typing—just talk naturally and watch your forms populate effortlessly. Our choice of **ReactJS** combined with **TailwindCSS** ensures the user interface remains intuitive, responsive, and visually appealing, enhancing the overall user interaction with clean, accessible design.

At the heart of Formify lies a **Django** backend, which robustly manages and secures data while integrating smoothly with an **SQLite** database for efficient data storage and retrieval. To guarantee instant, seamless communication, we've integrated continuous **WebSockets**, ensuring your voice inputs are processed and forms are updated instantly, delivering a fluid and engaging user experience.

Formify doesn't stop at simple speech-to-text conversions. We meticulously preprocess and refine voice data before it reaches OpenAI’s powerful language models. This careful optimization step, including real-time validation, ensures every input is accurately interpreted, resulting in quick, precise, and cost-effective interactions.

Through thoughtful design, meticulous technological decisions, and an emphasis on real-time responsiveness, Formify transforms mundane paperwork into delightful interactions—making form filling easier, more efficient, and even enjoyable.

## Challenges we ran into

Midway through the hackathon was challenging, especially as we focused on working out the intricate details, particularly related to databases and real-time functionality.
The main challenges we faced included:

1. **Real-Time Audio Integration:** Capturing audio input, turning it into accurate transcripts, and then mapping this conversational data onto specific form fields in real time was complex. Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the transcript while someone naturally spoke meant we had to balance speed with precision, making sure no critical information was lost or misunderstood and that the form was being updated and displayed in real time.

2. **Managing Natural Conversation Flow:** Conversations often naturally drift off-topic, become less structured, or explore deeper details. Our solution needed to intelligently filter and recognize the relevant information from free-flowing discussions, correctly populating specific form fields without interrupting the user's natural conversational style. Balancing natural interaction with structured data capture was particularly challenging.

3. **Learning Django and Database Systems from Scratch:** Our team had minimal prior experience with Django, SQL, and MongoDB. Diving into these technologies proved to be a significant learning curve—we found ourselves deep in documentation, tutorials, and forums, often getting caught in rabbit holes deciding between SQL and MongoDB, figuring out how Django handles relational databases, and understanding how best to store user-generated templates, preferences, and completed form data.

Despite these hurdles, the experience of overcoming these challenges was deeply rewarding, pushing us to collaborate closely, problem-solve creatively, and learn new skills rapidly—all with the ultimate goal of crafting a product that genuinely improves people's daily lives.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Our team's journey during this hackathon was both challenging and rewarding. We're particularly proud that our solution actually works effectively—it successfully integrates language processing and generates relevant, useful outputs. Our product's design is clean, simple, and friendly, creating an enjoyable user experience.

We learned a great deal about natural language processing and navigated languages and frameworks entirely new to us, pushing our technical boundaries and fostering significant personal growth. Most importantly, we came together strongly as a team, tackling late nights, spirited discussions, and all the memorable moments that come with such intense collaboration.

Overall, we're proud not only of what we've built but also of how we've grown together as a team throughout this exciting process.

## What we learned

This hackathon was an incredible journey filled with learning and growth. 

We dove into completely new territories, discovering how to navigate a **new programming language** and **integrate databases effectively**—something entirely new to our team. Mastering Django alongside relational databases like SQL and MongoDB was challenging.

Not only that, but figuring out **real-time audio transcription** and **accurately mapping it into usable data fields** also showed us the complexity of real-time applications. It required us to think deeply about accuracy and user interaction, ensuring our app would genuinely make life easier for its users.

One of the most valuable lessons was understanding how to **bridge natural conversation with structured form-filling through AI and real-time web integration**. We got first-hand experience on setting up web frameworks, specifically Django, and learned the nuances of keeping user data coherent, structured, and secure in databases.

And above all, this experience highlighted the **power of teamwork**. Each member brought their strengths, **learned entirely new skills**, and **supported each other along the way**. Despite the occasional frustration, late-night struggles, and last-minute bug fixes, our enthusiasm and shared commitment made this experience not only educational but genuinely fun. We're walking away with new skills, stronger teamwork, and a deeper appreciation for what we can accomplish together.

## What's next for Formify

Our next steps involve enabling users to create their own custom form building blocks, giving them greater flexibility and control to tailor forms exactly to their needs.

Additionally, we're planning to improve the retrieval process for filled templates, making it seamless and intuitive for users to access, edit, and reuse their information whenever necessary. 

Some other features we are considering include:
- Darkmode
- Implement create custom info blocks feauture
- Implement delete and rename form
- Change header to Formify with unique f logo
- Allow recording even after stop recording button is pressed, change back state after turn on start recording (hard)
- Allow redirection from login to dashboard if cookie already exists, and dashboard to login if no auth cookie exists, Fix redirection -> currently shows 404 errors when trying to access pages via the url directly.

The goal is to continuously refine our app, ensuring that it stays simple and genuinely helpful.
